## Sample network configuration file. This file would go into the repo itself.
## Adjust the file as necessary and put the required network interfaces.
## Remever the "bridges" setting in your localhost hostvars would need to match the interfaces defined here.
## You would reference the file by adding "network_conf_filename: my_network_file.cfg.j2"
